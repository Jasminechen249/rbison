R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X install with R 3.2.1 and R development version, Ubuntu running on Travis-CI, and Win builder.

This submission is mostly to fix a number of broken functions due to the
recent update in httr on CRAN to v1.0.

In addition, this package now imports non-base functions explicitly as
needed in accordance with R-devel changes.

Thanks! Scott Chamberlain
